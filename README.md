## Projects
### Microfluidic Device for Blood Plasma Separation and Fluorescence Detection of HIV-1 P24 Biomarkers 
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2020.112482)

Developed a handheld diagnostic device for the detection of HIV-1 P24 Biomarkers. This microfluidic device successfully demonstrated blood plasma separation, with a 31.8% yield and 99.9% plasma purity, comparable to a traditional centrifuge. The fluorescent detection of HIV-1 P24 antibodies from a whole blood control demonstrated a detection limit of 17 pg/µL. This portable chip shows a potential of highly sensitive, quantifiable, and rapid disease diagnostics.

### Wireless IoT IMU Controlled DJ Gloves 

Developed an IoT wireless IMU gloves connected to a DJ soundboard to recognize 6-axis gesture control to control volume, tempo, and pan of output speaker. Programmed using bare-meal embedded C and implemented SPI communciation, GPIO, and timers/interupts. Designed and lazar cut physical enclosure using Solid Works. Wireless communication of data was done using Zigbee protocol.
